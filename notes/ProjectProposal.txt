Python Final Proposal
I plan to make a sudoku solver with some simple algorithms. The game will probably have a
simple GUI that would allow the user to try to solve the puzzle. My solver will either check if the
solution is correct or it will actually solve the puzzle when the user requests the solution. I plan
to work alone in this project. I think this fulfils the project criteria since this is not a trivial task. I
know a similar homework is given in 521 but I have not taken that class nor I plan to so I think
this is fair game.
Requirements:
Probably will use a generator to generate pseudo random squares int sudoku
Custom class: I need few custom classes for good game design anyways so I am not worried
about this
Library usage: Random I have to use for pseudo random. Numpy.ndarray I will use for back-end
representation of sudoku matrix. And definetly multiple methods from itertools.
So therefore my game would satisfy conditions.
